## 📈 A Glimpse at My Activity

### 🗓️ My Year in Code
![Contribution Calendar](https://ghchart.rshah.org/LaurentMwana)

**What those little green squares say:**
- An almost daily coding routine, even on weekends
- Activity spikes on complex backend projects
- More commits on PHP/Symfony than frontend (though React is catching up!)

**Recent focus areas:**
- Building robust APIs with Symfony and API Platform
- Database architecture for payment systems
- UI/UX with Tailwind CSS and Next.js

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

### **Backend (my playground)**
- **PHP**: Symfony, Laravel, API Platform – where business logic comes to life
- **Node.js**: For lighter APIs or JS-based tools
- **Databases**: MySQL for daily work, PostgreSQL for serious projects

### **Frontend (where everything shows)**
- **Next.js/React**: For fast, modern interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Because preventing bugs is better than fixing them
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling without leaving HTML

### **Keeping things running**
- **Docker**: So everything works the same on every machine
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating tests and deployments
- **Git**: My complete history of coding adventures
